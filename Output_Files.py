Purpose: This program takes assembled contigs that were aligned to query sequence and writes two files. The first will
only contain the sequence of the largest assembled contig containing the query sequence. The second file will contain
contig info including the name of the reads that were used to assemble the contig, the name of the contig, starting and
ending coordinates in the sequencing read that matched with the query, and the starting and ending coordinates of the
contig that matched with the query sequence.
