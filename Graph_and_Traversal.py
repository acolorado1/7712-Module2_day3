Purpose: This program takes several sequences, find all kmers (edges), get k-1mers (nodes), create an
adjacency list of them (graph) and using DFS (Depth First Search) graph traversal get all possible paths in the graph.
Sets of starting nodes (those nodes with an in-degree of 0) and ending nodes (those nodes with an out-degree of 0) will
be found and the smaller list will be used as starting nodes for graph traversal and contig creation. Output will be a
dictionary containing all traversed nodes in all paths, and the constructed contig from each path.
